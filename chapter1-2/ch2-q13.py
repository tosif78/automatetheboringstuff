# Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
# Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# For loop example

print('Using For loop')
for num in range(1,11):
  print(num)

# while loop

print('Using While loop')

numWhile = 1
while numWhile <= 10:
  print(numWhile)
  numWhile = numWhile + 1
